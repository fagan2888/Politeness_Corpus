# Politeness_Corpus
Updated code and files from my work on the Stanford Politeness Corpus

Here's a link to some of that work:

Many thanks to the original team and to Ben for their work here! 

## Background
This work emerged from my exploration of data on politeness to fit in with dissertation on game-theoretic modeling of requests. 

## How-To
I had trouble getting this to work at first. I hope you profit from my initial failures. I'll update this more as I go, with instructions for dummies like myself! 

## Contents

### Re-written classifier package CLS2 and folder Politeness2

The original classifier prints two probabilities for every sentence as follows: 

\{"Could you please play some Sigur Ros?" : \[.7, .3\] \}

I'm not great with messy outputs, I've rewritten some of their classifier's code to make the output a little prettier. Hope you like it! 

\{"Could you please play some Sigur Ros?" : .7 \}
